## About

In this notebook, I developed a model aimed at predicting aparment price in Mexico city. The purpose is not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps needed to build such a model. I also explained the possible methods to deploy the model, these include wrapping the model in a function so that a programmer can provide inputs and then receive a prediction as output or creating an interactive dashboard, where a user can supply values and receive a prediction.
